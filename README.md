# AI Timeline

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Timeline, showcasing the evolution and advancements in artificial intelligence technologies from 2022 to the present. This timeline highlights key milestones, releases, and developments from leading companies and projects in the AI field.

## Overview

This timeline is structured chronologically, organized by year, and includes significant events, releases, and updates in the artificial intelligence landscape. From the introduction of new models and updates to open-source releases and major announcements, this timeline provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamic AI industry's progress over the years.

## Features

- **Year-wise Organization:** Events and releases are grouped by year for easy navigation.
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Each event includes brief descriptions providing context.
- **Highlighting Key Events:** Important milestones are visually marked.
- **Sortable Timeline:** View events from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices.
- **External Links:** A curated list of additional resources for further reading.

## How to Use

1.  **View the Timeline:** Visit the [Artificial Intelligence Timeline](https://nhlocal.github.io/AiTimeline/) to explore the events.
2.  **Navigate:** Scroll through the timeline or use the year navigation links at the top.
3.  **Sort:** Use the "Sort" button to toggle between chronological and reverse-chronological order.
4.  **Explore:** Read the details for each monthly event.

## How the Site Works (Technical Details)

The website is generated using **Jekyll**, a static site generator. Content is primarily managed through data files and Markdown, making updates straightforward.

**Key Files and Directories:**

*   **`_data/timeline.yml`**: Contains the structured timeline data in YAML format. **This file is automatically generated** and is what Jekyll uses to build the timeline on the site.
*   **`_data/timeline.md`**: Contains the timeline data in Markdown format. **This is the recommended file for contributors to edit.**
*   **`scripts/convert_timeline_events.py`**: A Python script used to convert the Markdown timeline (`timeline.md`) into the YAML format (`timeline.yml`) required by Jekyll.
*   **`_data/links.yml`**: Contains the list of external links displayed in the footer section.
*   **`index.md`**: The main content file for the homepage layout and structure.
*   **`_layouts/default.html`**: The main HTML template for the site pages.
*   **`_includes/footer.html`**: Reusable HTML component for the site footer.
*   **`assets/`**: Contains CSS styles (`styles.css`), JavaScript (`script.js`), and images/icons.
*   **`_config.yml`**: Jekyll configuration file (e.g., site URL).
*   **`Gemfile`**: Ruby dependencies for Jekyll.

The core workflow involves editing the timeline in the human-readable `_data/timeline.md` file and then using the Python script to generate the machine-readable `_data/timeline.yml` file, which Jekyll uses to render the webpage.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to keep the timeline comprehensive and current! Here's how you can contribute:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of this repository to your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3.  **Add or Update Events (Recommended Method):**
    *   Open the **`_data/timeline.md`** file in your text editor.
    *   Add new events or modify existing ones following the Markdown structure. Use `## Month Name` for dates and simple list items (`-`) for event details. Use `**bold text**` for emphasis.
        ```markdown
        # Year: 2025
        ## March
        - **New Amazing AI Model Released!**
        - More details about the release.
        - Another event in the same month.
        ```
    *   **Important Step: Convert Markdown to YAML**
        *   Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
        *   Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository in your terminal.
        *   Run the conversion script:
            ```bash
            python scripts/convert_timeline_events.py
            ```
        *   When prompted for the input file path, enter: `_data/timeline.md`
        *   The script will automatically process `_data/timeline.md` and **overwrite** the `_data/timeline.yml` file with the updated, correctly formatted YAML data.

4.  **Add or Update Links (Optional):**
    *   If you want to add relevant external links, edit the **`_data/links.yml`** file, following the existing structure:
        ```yaml
        - text: Description of the Link
          url: https://example.com/relevant-article
        ```

5.  **Commit and Push:**
    *   Stage your changes. **Make sure to include both the modified `_data/timeline.md` AND the generated `_data/timeline.yml` files (and `_data/links.yml` if changed).**
        ```bash
        git add _data/timeline.md _data/timeline.yml _data/links.yml
        ```
    *   Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Add AI event for March 2025"
        ```
    *   Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
        ```bash
        git push origin main # Or your branch name
        ```

6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the original `NHLOCAL/AiTimeline` repository.

7.  **Review and Merge:** Your PR will be reviewed, and once approved, it will be merged into the main timeline.

## Running the Site Locally (Optional)

If you'd like to preview your changes locally before submitting a pull request:

1.  **Install Prerequisites:**
    *   **Ruby:** Jekyll requires Ruby. Install it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) or use your system's package manager.
    *   **Bundler:** Install the Bundler gem: `gem install bundler`
    *   **Python:** Required if you plan to run the `convert_timeline_events.py` script. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Install Jekyll and Dependencies:**
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
    *   Install the gems specified in the `Gemfile`:
        ```bash
        bundle install
        ```

3.  **Build and Serve:**
    *   Run the Jekyll development server:
        ```bash
        bundle exec jekyll serve
        ```
    *   *(Windows users can alternatively try running the `start.bat` script, which executes the command above).*

4.  **View Locally:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4000/AiTimeline/` (or the address provided by the `jekyll serve` command, respecting the `baseurl` from `_config.yml`).
